The goal is to allow the user to easily combine and modify a set of primitive models to construct complicated source structures. The benefit of this approach is that it is straightforward to construct different source models out of these primitives. Namely, an end-user does not have to create a separate source &quot;model&quot; every time they change the model specification. Additionally, most models currently implemented are differentiable with at Enzyme. This allows for gradient accelerated optimization and sampling (e.g., HMC) to be used with little effort by the end user.</p><div class="warning custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Warning</p><p>As of 0.11 Comrade will only support AD with Enzyme.
