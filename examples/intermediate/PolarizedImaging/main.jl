# # Polarized Image and Instrumental Modeling

# In this tutorial, we will analyze a simulated simple polarized dataset to demonstrate
# Comrade's polarized imaging capabilities.

# ## Introduction to Polarized Imaging
# The EHT is a polarized interferometer. However, like all VLBI interferometers, it does not
# directly measure the Stokes parameters (I, Q, U, V). Instead, it measures components
# related to the electric field at the telescope along two *directions* using feeds.
# There are two types of feeds at telescopes: circular, which measure $R/L$ components of the
# electric field, and linear feeds, which measure $X/Y$ components of the electric field.
# Most sites in the EHT use circular feeds, meaning they measure the right (R) and left
# electric field (L) at each telescope. Although note that ALMA actually uses linear feeds.
# Currently Comrade has the ability to fit natively mixed polarization data however, the
# publically released EHT data has been converted to circular polarization.
# For a VLBI array whose feeds are purely circluar the **coherency matrices** are given by,
#
# ```math
#  C_{ij} = \begin{pmatrix}
#        RR^* &  RL^*\\
#        LR^* &  LL^*
#      \end{pmatrix}.
# ```
#
# These coherency matrices are the fundamental object in interferometry and what
# the telescope observes. For a perfect interferometer, these circular coherency matrices
# are related to the usual Fourier transform of the stokes parameters by
#
# ```math
#   \begin{pmatrix}
#       \tilde{I}\\ \tilde{Q} \\ \tilde{U} \\ \tilde{V}
#   \end{pmatrix}
#   =\frac{1}{2}
#   \begin{pmatrix}
#      RR^* + LL^* \\
#      RL^* + LR^* \\
#      i(LR^* - RL^*)\\
#      RR^* - LL^*
#   \end{pmatrix}.
# ```
#-
# !!! note
#     In this tutorial, we stick to circular feeds but Comrade has the capabilities
#     to model linear (XX,XY, ...) and mixed basis coherencies (e.g., RX, RY, ...).
#-
#
# In reality, the measure coherencies are corrupted by both the atmosphere and the
# telescope itself. In `Comrade` we use the RIME formalism [^1] to represent these corruptions,
# namely our measured coherency matrices $V_{ij}$ are given by
# ```math
#    V_{ij} = J_iC_{ij}J_j^\dagger
# ```
# where $J$ is known as a *Jones matrix* and $ij$ denotes the baseline $ij$ with sites $i$ and $j$.
#-
# `Comrade` is highly flexible with how the Jones matrices are formed and provides several
# convenience functions that parameterize standard Jones matrices. These matrices include:
#   - [`JonesG`](@ref) which builds the set of complex gain Jones matrices
# ```math
#   G = \begin{pmatrix}
#           g_a   &0\\
#           0     &g_b\\
#       \end{pmatrix}
# ```
#   - [`JonesD`](@ref) which builds the set of complex d-terms Jones matrices
# ```math
#   D = \begin{pmatrix}
#           1   & d_a\\
#           d_b     &1\\
#       \end{pmatrix}
# ```
#   - [`JonesR`](@ref) is the basis transform matrix $T$. This transformation is special and
#      combines two things using the decomposition $T=FB$. The first, $B$, is the transformation from
#      some reference basis to the observed coherency basis (this allows for mixed basis measurements).
#      The second is the feed rotation, $F$, that transforms from some reference axis to the axis of the
#      telescope as the source moves in the sky. The feed rotation matrix `F` for circular feeds
#      in terms of the per station feed rotation angle $\varphi$ is
# ```math
#   F = \begin{pmatrix}
#           e^{-i\varphi}   & 0\\
#           0     & e^{i\varphi}\\
#       \end{pmatrix}
# ```
#-
#
#  In the rest of the tutorial, we are going to solve for all of these instrument model terms in
#  while re-creating the polarized image from the first [`EHT results on M87`](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/abe71d).


# ## Load the Data
# To get started we will load Comrade
using Comrade

# ## Load the Data
using Pyehtim

# For reproducibility we use a stable random number genreator
using StableRNGs
rng = StableRNG(42)


# Now we will load some synthetic polarized data.
fname = Base.download(
    "https://de.cyverse.org/anon-files/iplant/home/shared/commons_repo/curated/EHTC_M87pol2017_Nov2023/hops_data/April11/SR2_M87_2017_101_lo_hops_ALMArot.uvfits",
    joinpath(__DIR, "m87polarized.uvfits")
)
obs = Pyehtim.load_uvfits_and_array(
    fname,
    joinpath(__DIR, "..", "..", "Data", "array.txt"), polrep = "circ"
)


# Notice that, unlike other non-polarized tutorials, we need to include a second argument.
# This is the **array file** of the observation and is required to determine the feed rotation
# of the array.

# Now we scan average the data since the data to boost the SNR and reduce the total data volume.
obs = scan_average(obs).add_fractional_noise(0.01).flag_uvdist(uv_min = 0.1e9)
#-
# Now we extract our observed/corrupted coherency matrices.
dvis = extract_table(obs, Coherencies())

# ##Building the Model/Posterior


# To build the model, we first break it down into two parts:
#    1. **The image or sky model**. In Comrade, all polarized image models are written in terms of the Stokes parameters.
#       In this tutorial, we will use a polarized image model based on Pesce (2021)[^2], and
#       parameterizes each pixel in terms of the [`Poincare sphere`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unpolarized_light#Poincar%C3%A9_sphere).
#       This parameterization ensures that we have all the physical properties of stokes parameters.
#       Note that we also have a parameterization in terms of hyperbolic trig functions `VLBISkyModels.PolExp2Map`
#    2. **The instrument model**. The instrument model specifies the model that describes the impact of instrumental and atmospheric effects.
#       We will be using the $J = GDR$ decomposition we described above. However, to parameterize the
#       R/L complex gains, we will be using a gain product and ratio decomposition. The reason for this decomposition
#       is that in realistic measurements, the gain ratios and products have different temporal characteristics.
#       Namely, many of the EHT observations tend to demonstrate constant R/L gain ratios across an
#       nights observations, compared to the gain products, which vary every scan. Additionally,
#       the gain ratios tend to be smaller (i.e., closer to unity) than the gain products.
#       Using this apriori knowledge, we can build this into our model and reduce
#       the total number of parameters we need to model.


# First we specify our sky model. As always `Comrade` requires this to be a two argument
# function where the first argument is typically a NamedTuple of parameters we will fit
# and the second are additional metadata required to build the model.
using StatsFuns: logistic
function sky(θ, metadata)
    (; c, σ, p, p0, pσ, angparams) = θ
    (; mimg, ftot) = metadata
    ## Build the stokes I model
    rast = apply_fluctuations(CenteredLR(), mimg, σ .* c.params)
    brast = baseimage(rast)
    brast .= ftot .* brast
    ## The total polarization fraction is modeled in logit space so we transform it back
    pim = logistic.(p0 .+ pσ .* p.params)
    ## Build our IntensityMap
    pmap = PoincareSphere2Map(rast, pim, angparams)
    ## Construct the actual image model which uses a third order B-spline pulse
    m = ContinuousImage(pmap, BSplinePulse{3}())
    ## Finally find the image centroid and shift it to be at the center
    x0, y0 = centroid(pmap)
    ms = shifted(m, -x0, -y0)
    return ms
end


# Now, we define the model metadata required to build the model.
# We specify our image grid and cache model needed to define the polarimetric
# image model. Our image will be a 10x10 raster with a 60μas FOV.
using Distributions
using VLBIImagePriors
fovx = μas2rad(200.0)
fovy = μas2rad(200.0)
nx = ny = 32
grid = imagepixels(fovx, fovy, nx, ny)

fwhmfac = 2 * sqrt(2 * log(2))
mpr = modify(Gaussian(), Stretch(μas2rad(50.0) ./ fwhmfac))
mimg = intensitymap(mpr, grid)

# For the image metadata we specify the grid and the total flux of the image, which is 1.0.
# Note that we specify the total flux out front since it is degenerate with an overall shift
# in the gain amplitudes.
skymeta = (; mimg = mimg ./ flux(mimg), ftot = 0.6);


# We use again use a GMRF prior similar to the [Imaging a Black Hole using only Closure Quantities](@ref) tutorial
# for the log-ratio transformed image. We use the same correlated image prior for the inverse-logit transformed
# total polarization. The mean total polarization fraction `p0` is centered at -2.0 with a standard deviation of 2.0
# which logit transformed puts most of the prior mass < 0.8 fractional polarization. The standard deviation of the
# total polarization fraction `pσ` again uses a Half-normal process. The angular parameters of the polarizaton are
# given by a uniform prior on the sphere.
cprior = corr_image_prior(grid, dvis)
skyprior = (
    c = cprior,
    σ = Exponential(0.1),
    p = cprior,
    p0 = Normal(-2.0, 2.0),
    pσ = truncated(Normal(0.0, 1.0); lower = 0.01),
    angparams = ImageSphericalUniform(nx, ny),
)

skym = SkyModel(sky, skyprior, grid; metadata = skymeta)


# Now we build the instrument model. Due to the complexity of VLBI the instrument model is critical
# to the success of imaging and getting reliable results. For this example we will use the standard
# instrument model used in polarized EHT analyses expressed in the RIME formalism. Our Jones
# decomposition will be given by `GDR`, where `G` are the complex gains, `D` are the d-terms, and `R`
# is what we call the *ideal instrument response*, which is how an ideal interferometer using the
# feed basis we observe relative to some reference basis.
#
# Given the possible flexibility in different parameterizations of the individual Jones matrices
# each Jones matrix requires the user to specify a function that converts from parameters
# to specific parameterization f the jones matrices.

# For the complex gain matrix, we used the `JonesG` jones matrix. The first argument is now
# a function that converts from the parameters to the complex gain matrix. In this case, we
# will use a amplitude and phase decomposition of the complex gain matrix. Note that since
# the gain matrix is a diagonal 2x2 matrix the function must return a 2-element tuple.
# The first element of the tuple is the gain for the first polarization feed (R) and the
# second is the gain for the second polarization feed (L).
function fgain(x)
    gR = exp(x.lgR + 1im * x.gpR)
    gL = gR * exp(x.lgrat + 1im * x.gprat)
    return gR, gL
end
G = JonesG(fgain)


# Similarly we provide a `JonesD` function for the leakage terms. Since we assume that we
# are in the small leakage limit, we will use the decomposition
# 1 d1
# d2 1
# Therefore, there are 2 free parameters for the JonesD our parameterization function
# must return a 2-element tuple. For d-terms we will use a re-im parameterization.
function fdterms(x)
    dR = complex(x.dRx, x.dRy)
    dL = complex(x.dLx, x.dLy)
    return dR, dL
end
D = JonesD(fdterms)

# Finally we define our response Jones matrix. This matrix is a basis transform matrix
# plus the feed rotation angle for each station. These are typically set by the telescope
# so there are no free parameters, so no parameterization is necessary.
R = JonesR(; add_fr = true)

# Finally, we build our total Jones matrix by using the `JonesSandwich` function. The
# first argument is a function that specifies how to combine each Jones matrix. In this case
# we will use the standard decomposition J = adjoint(R)*G*D*R, where we need to apply the adjoint
# of the feed rotaion matrix `R` because the data has feed rotation calibration.
js(g, d, r) = adjoint(r) * g * d * r
J = JonesSandwich(js, G, D, R)

# !!! note
#     This is a general note that for arrays with non-zero leakage, feed rotation calibration
#     does not remove the impact of feed rotations on the instrument model. That is,
#     when modeling feed rotation must be taken into account. This is because
#     the R and D matrices are not commutative. Therefore, to recover the correct instrumental
#     terms we must include the feed rotation calibration in the instrument model. This is not
#     ideal when doing polarized modeling, especially for interferometers using a mixture of linear
#     and circular feeds. For linear feeds R does not commute with G or D and applying feed rotation
#     calibration before solving for gains can mix gains and leakage with feed rotation calibration terms
#     breaking many of the typical assumptions about the stabilty of different instrument effects.

# For the instrument prior, we will use a simple IID prior for the complex gains and d-terms.
# The `IIDSitePrior` function specifies that each site has the same prior and each value is independent
# on some time segment. The current time segments are
#  - `ScanSeg()` which specifies each scan has an independent value
#  - `TrackSeg()` which says that the value is constant over the track.
#  - `IntegSeg()` which says that the value changes each integration time
# For the released EHT data, the calibration procedure makes gains stable over each scan
# so we use `ScanSeg` for those quantities. The d-terms are typically stable over the track
# so we use `TrackSeg` for those.
intprior = (
    lgR = ArrayPrior(IIDSitePrior(ScanSeg(), Normal(0.0, 0.2)); LM = IIDSitePrior(ScanSeg(), Normal(0.0, 1.0))),
    lgrat = ArrayPrior(IIDSitePrior(ScanSeg(), Normal(0.0, 0.1))),
    gpR = ArrayPrior(IIDSitePrior(ScanSeg(), DiagonalVonMises(0.0, inv(π^2))); refant = SEFDReference(0.0), phase = true),
    gprat = ArrayPrior(IIDSitePrior(ScanSeg(), DiagonalVonMises(0.0, inv(0.1^2))); refant = SingleReference(:AA, 0.0), phase = true),
    dRx = ArrayPrior(IIDSitePrior(TrackSeg(), Normal(0.0, 0.2))),
    dRy = ArrayPrior(IIDSitePrior(TrackSeg(), Normal(0.0, 0.2))),
    dLx = ArrayPrior(IIDSitePrior(TrackSeg(), Normal(0.0, 0.2))),
    dLy = ArrayPrior(IIDSitePrior(TrackSeg(), Normal(0.0, 0.2))),
)

# Finally, we can build our instrument model which takes a model for the Jones matrix `J`
# and priors for each term in the Jones matrix.
intmodel = InstrumentModel(J, intprior)

# intmodel = InstrumentModel(JonesR(;add_fr=true))
# Putting it all together, we form our likelihood and posterior objects for optimization and
# sampling, and specifying to use Enzyme.Reverse with runtime activity for AD.
using Enzyme
post = VLBIPosterior(skym, intmodel, dvis)

# ## Reconstructing the Image and Instrument Effects

# To sample from this posterior, it is convenient to move from our constrained parameter space
# to an unconstrained one (i.e., the support of the transformed posterior is (-∞, ∞)). This transformation is
# done using the `asflat` function.
tpost = asflat(post)

# We can also query the dimension of our posterior or the number of parameters we will sample.
# !!! warning
#     This can often be different from what you would expect. This difference is especially true when using
#     angular variables, where we often artificially increase the dimension
#     of the parameter space to make sampling easier.
#-

# Now we optimize. Unlike other imaging examples, we move straight to gradient optimizers
# due to the higher dimension of the space. In addition the only AD package that can currently
# work with the polarized Comrade posterior is Enzyme.
